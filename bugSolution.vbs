Error Handling:  The most effective way to address late binding issues is to incorporate robust error handling using the `On Error Resume Next` and `Err` object. This allows your script to catch runtime errors and either handle them gracefully or at least prevent the script from crashing.

Example:

```vbscript
On Error Resume Next
Dim obj
Set obj = CreateObject("Some.Unknown.Object")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  MsgBox "Error creating object or accessing method: " & Err.Description
  Err.Clear
Else
  'Check to make sure the method exists before calling it
  If TypeName(obj) = "Some.Unknown.Object" Then
    result = obj.NonExistentMethod()
  Else
    MsgBox "Object type mismatch" 
  End If
End If
```

**Note:**  Early binding (explicitly declaring object types) is generally preferred for performance and improved error detection, but it requires knowing the exact object type at compile time, which might not always be possible with external libraries.
